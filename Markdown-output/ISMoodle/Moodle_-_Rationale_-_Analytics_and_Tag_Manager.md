# Moodle - Rationale - Analytics and Tag Manager

## Events to collect data about interactions

Google Analytics gives you the digital analytics tools to analyse data for a deeper understanding of the user experience.

Events are user interactions with content that can be tracked independently from a web page or a screen load.

With just a small amount of extra code, you can start collecting data on a whole host of additional activities that happen on your website which cannot be tracked with the standard Google Analytics code.

From clicks on buttons or links, to how much of a form was filled in.

## Why Google Tag Manager

A Tag Management System (TMS) replaces hard-coded tags that are used for marketing, analytics, and testing on a website, with dynamic tags that are easier to implement and update.

Every tag management system uses a container tag â€“ a small snippet of code that allows you to dynamically insert tags into your website.

You can think of container tags as buckets that hold other types of tags. You control which tags are added to the buckets using a simple web interface.

The benefits of tag management (and specifically Google Tag Manager) are enormous.

You can add and update Google Analytics tags directly from Google Tag Manager, instead of editing site code.

This reduces errors and allows you to quickly deploy tags on your site.
