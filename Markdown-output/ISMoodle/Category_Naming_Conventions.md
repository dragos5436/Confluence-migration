**Naming convention for Category ID number:**

YEAR \_ 3 digit faculty code \_ 5 digit department code \_ 4 digit entity code

**2022\_ART\_GRKLT\_CLAS** (for Faculty of Arts and Humanities, department of Greek and Latin, entity Classics, academic year 2022/23).

**2022\_ART\_GRKLT\_PROG** (for Faculty of Arts and Humanities, department of Greek and Latin, Programmes, academic year 2022/23).

For the ‘Programmes’ and ‘Miscellaneous’ categories we can use **PROG** and **MISC** instead of the entity code as they do not exist as official entities.

(As there’s the possibility of having a new entity called PROG or MISC in the future, we could use PRXX and MIXX instead.)
