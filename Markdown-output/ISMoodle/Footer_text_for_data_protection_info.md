# Footer text for data protection info

Replace the text in footer.html for each of the ucl themes so that it displays:

Data Protection Act 1988:  UCL Moodle users are reminded that their use of Moodle will be logged and that this information, with other personal data about them contained within the system, will be used by tutors and/or facilitators to monitor their participation, progress and completion of the courses.

Modify /themes/ucl\*/footer.html 

This has been applied to the footers in moodle 1.93 on the pre-production and development web servers.
