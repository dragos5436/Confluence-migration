# Group submission error - Moodle assignment

Creating an assignment in Moodle and setting  **'Students submit in groups' to 'Yes'**

seems to create an error

Whereby when trying to view assignment submissions, one gets a message similar to:

# Error when adding a grouping access restriction to workshop: Incorrect number of query parameters. Expected 20, got 19

 

The 3 following issues in the Moodle tracker seem close but are not exactly the same. Also, they are marked as 'closed':

<https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-53481>

 

<https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-54605>

 

<https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-56466>

 

Works OK in PP   and Sammy312 - imported course to PP doesnt work.

Not OK everywhere else

 

There is another issue in PP where you cant see the whole assignment after saving - comment permissions - something to do with the course admin and tutor role. Get error as course admin/tutor, dont if you arent course admin/tutor.
