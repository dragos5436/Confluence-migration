<td><p>'Course Overview' instead of My Courses on Home page.</p>
<p>1) Do we want Course Overview with activities which &quot;need attention&quot;</p>
<p>2) If yes, do we like layout ?</p>
<p>3) Is there any logical order to the list ?  Can it be set to Alphabetical by Course full name ?</p></td>
<td><p>ZW - I like the activities, but think Font is too large and courses blur into one another.  Suggest different coloured background / cell or indent activities to the right.</p>
<p>RD - I also prefer the course overview and agree regarding the course title font being a bit big - it would be good to have a choice to sort alphabetically but if there had to be one default I think putting those courses with elements that 'need attention' at the top of the list makes sense.</p></td>
