# Marks Transfer integration roadmap

T1 23-24

-   Pilot 1 and analysis - done
-   « one-to-many » - Mapping one Moodle Activity to multiple assessment components for different module deliveries - done
-   Course level view - «  Assessment Wizard » - select existing only
-   Pilot 2 (late December & early January)

T2 23-24

-   ability to push all at course level
-   Late / non-submission reporting
-   Go live of Marks transfer integration UCL wide - 20th March 2024

T3 23-24

-   resits, retakes, repeats, re-assessments, etc
-   oral marks recorded in moodle use case
-   End of Academic Year Exam period - April/May/June

T4 23-24

-   SORAs and ECs
-   "create new" in assessment wizard
-   LSA in September
-   gradebook & LTIs - (pushed back gradebook to TI4 instead of TI2 keep initial rollout simple & encourage more accurate recording in SITS)

24-25

-   « many to one» Turnitin (may do earlier if we find time)
-   workshop, Turnitin multi-part 

Won’t do:

-   push grades from a scale e.g. A-F (being phased out)
-   continuous updating of grades as marking takes place - proper integration ( conservative approach to risk)
-   Decimal points in Turnitin (use Moodle Assignment with Turnitin)
-   allow marks transfer from Turnitin before marks &feedback are released & anonymity revealed (no / clarify use case)
