# Moodle Safe Exam Browser process

To run an assessment on premises, the recommendation is to use the cluster rooms where the lockdown browser will be regularly monitored and updated. Guidance for faculties and students on this will be created by Moodle DLE team. All of the machines will need to be checked before each assessment to ensure there is no hardware or software issues on the day.

## Cluster rooms

To ensure that Moodle's Safe Exam Browser is available and operational for students to use on [UCL managed devices](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/computers/ucl-enabled-devices), the following process has been agreed with the Endpoint Management Team:

-   If there is a new version of the Safe exam browser, DLE team will fill in this form: <https://forms.office.com/e/JL0LayT4tQ>
    -   the form automatically creates a Jira ticket for the EM team
    -   it also generates a service request ticket number
    -   The form can be filled as follows:
    -   Form:
        1. Teaching
        2. Safe Exam Browser
        3. &lt;from release notes&gt;
        4. Desktop@UCL
        5. confirm
        6. skip
        7. No license required
        8. not applicable
        9. Teaching term - next occurring/most recent
        10. asap
        11. na
        12. na
        13. update and attach [this pre-filled version](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/LTALearning-DigEdchannel/EZM5j75Np0NKrFb-uej38zAB0HascSd9nODrZhGf6Kk31A?e=kk9fBS)
        14. confirm
        15. n/a

-   Once the ticket number is received, we email it to the EM team (Anthony Peacock and Justin Marshall) to let them know we’ve submitted the request
-   The EM team will them prioritise the request and let us now when then browser is available for testing and will ask for a UCL PC number to install the test version on. Once provided, they'll install the browser on the PC in question for testing 
-   Provided there are no issues, we then notify the EM team and they push the browser out to all UCL managed teaching (via Software Centre) and learning (installed directly) devices 
-   There is **no additional installation** that students or teachers need to do on cluster rooms PCs.
-   Prior to any assessments, faculties **should be advised to check** the machines they’re planning on using to ensure the lockdown browser’s working

## Loan Laptops

There are three types of loans available to students:

1.  self-service cabinets in libraries, checking out a device (without a charger) for up to 24 hours - NOT SUITABLE FOR ASSESSMENT
2.  short-term laptop scheme for up to 6 months  - students can request for any software to be downloaded by raising a service request, provided there's a justification for them to do so. 
3.  long-term laptop scheme for students from low-income households - students can download any software they need as these laptops are wiped after each loan

For the second option, with a little bit of planning and communication between the DAAs and the faculties (and students), the latest version of the lockdown browser could be installed in advance for those students who have the laptops on loan and have an assessment coming up.

## Desktop@UCL Anywhere

[Desktop@UCL Anywhere](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/computers/remote-access/desktopucl-anywhere) is not a suitable option for *any *device to run an assessment because of the nature of the application, which would only 'lock' the browser inside the Desktop@UCL Anywhere, but not the rest of the machine.

This renders the following NOT SUITABLE FOR ASSESSMENT:

-   any personal laptops or loan laptops where the latest lockdown browser hasn't been installed (either by students themselves or by raising a request with TechOps)
-   any machines in Birkbeck 

Above process is based on Assessment and Feedback team process for the Wiseflow locked down browser: <https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/E-exams/SitePages/WISEflow%20lockdown%20browser%20support.aspx?web=1&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI0OS8yNDAzMTQxNDcyMSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D&CT=1715264204133&OR=OWA-NT-Calendar&CID=80f1725f-54ed-5990-2e95-ee779d369d44>
