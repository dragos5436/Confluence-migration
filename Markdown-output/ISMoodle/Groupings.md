# Groupings

## About

Groupings is a course wide setting that provides additional grouping settings in groups and in activities. It is not currently available for the following activities: Journal, PLP, Scheduler.

## Issues 

Groupings does not work correctly with the following types of forums: 

-   single simple discussion forum
-   Q and A forum

The reply link is missing on the 'single simple discussion forum' and 'Q and A forum'. Other forum types allow the user to reply and post with groupings turned on ('Each person posts one discussion' & 'Standard forum for general use' work fine with groupings).

## To do

-   Write an FAQ about groupings for the LTSS site - Jess 

## Notes

Works for activities, but not resources (e.g. books, files, directories, links, learning objects etc.) in 1.9 - works with both activities & resources in 1.9.3.

-   The activity appears in the gradebook for all users (even those not in the grouping) and if 'Aggregate only non-empty grades' is unchecked the students not in the groupings will get 0. This will affect the final grades. See MDL-13868. This can be overcome by adding any graded activities with groupings enabled to a grade category that has the 'Aggregate only non-empty grades' setting checked.
-   See <http://docs.moodle.org/en/Groupings> for further info.

## Recommendation

Suitable for all activities and resources providing any graded items are in a grade category that is set to 'Aggregate only non-empty grades'.
