Dear Steve,

I have completed your request. It is a significant change which impacts
all staff in your department. As the LTSS is likely to field a number of
queries on this issue we would appreciate it if you could send an email
to the affected staff to let them know that their access to Moodle
courses has now changed at the request of the department, and what it
will mean for them:

* All ANAT, PHAR and PHOL staff have been given the role of
'Departmental Guest'. This role can browse all other ANAT, PHAR and PHOL
courses. Department guests: can preview quizzes; can view but can not
participate in discussions; can view files that are available to
students, can not view items hidden from students and can not view
participant lists.

* When logging into Moodle each user's list of courses is going to be
very much longer because they will now see courses they Departmental
Guests on as well as the courses on which they are Tutors.

* All courses’ "Participant lists" will now also contain the names of
all staff who have the Department Guest role. To display just the
students enrolled in the course please choose 'Student' from the drop
down menu.

The new departmental administrators have privileges to view and change
all the courses in the ANAT, PHAR and PHOL categories. Not only can they
enrol others in the course, they can changes grades and quizzes, add and
delete content. We would ask that the people with this role are careful
not to enrol students into courses using an incorrect role, and also
that you are happy to have these people in this role.

A final request, I would appreciate it if someone from your department
could check and amend the list of staff have added as departmental
guests against the list you supplied me with. I would like someone to
verify that I have not inadvertently added students who would now be
able to repeatedly preview quizzes which would enable them to obtain
correct answers for any courses in the ANAT, PHAR and PHOL categories.

I hope that this sounds reasonable – I’m sure you appreciate that we
need to be cautious when responding to requests like this, and are
anxious to avoid unnecessary queries from staff.

Regards

Tina
