# TO UPDATE? - Moodle - mapping login

# Tracking the Moodle login process and why it might be slow.

Work in progress - this document contains a quick overview of the login process, then a list of all the SQL queries, looks at filesizes and suggests some next steps.

This has been deduced from a combination of stepping through with the debugger, printing SQL debug to screen and logging the SQL queries within MySQL. Also it borrows heavily from: <http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Authentication_plugins>.

## Overview of login process

The following process takes place when you login to Moodle at UCL.

After entering your name and password into the LOGIN form and submitting it, the handler code in /login/index.php does the following:

-   First it gets a list of enabled authentication plugins. *In our case the main one of interest is ldap.*
-   It checks the username is valid in terms of allowed characters.
-   It calls authenticate\_user\_login() in lib/moodlelib.php which returns a user object (success) or false if none of the plugins authenticated successfully. *See below for detail on this function.*
-   After authentication - or all the plugins have been tried - the user is then redirected to a new page. This is either the login page (if there was a problem) or somewhere appropriate for a correct log in.

**authenticate\_user\_login()**

This gets a list of authenticated plugins (again).

This then looks up the supplied username in mdl\_user. It checks to see if the user is allowed to log in and which authentication plugin to use.

A user object is then created:

-   an empty one for a new user
-   populated with information from mdl\_user for an existing user.

It calls the user\_login() function for ldap. This returns true or false. (If false - it will try any other authentication plugins that are enabled).

If authenticated successfully and an existing user, it calls update\_user\_record() to get the latest information from ldap and amend the Moodle user record. For a new user it will create the Moodle user record (using some info from ldap).

It calls the plugin's sync\_roles() function? Not sure what this is for yet.

It then returns a user object or false if it failed.

*(Actually new users are redirected to their profile page).*

## Database queries

The SQL queries used are listed below in the order they occur. I've also attempted to flag up what is happening - eg: the point at which ldap is accessed using hints in italics.

*NB: The SQL shown further below is from a successful login which then redirects to the home page. Also some of the queries seem to be run several times from different functions.*

## Conclusions?

When logging in the user is basically experiencing "two pages" worth of quite intense processing as well as querying an external ldap server twice, this might explain why it's a little slow sometimes.

Moodle is not optimised for speed - mainly because it has to deliver personalised content. The UCL Moodle home page requires 20 HTTP requests and has a total weight of 394.4K.

Rearrange the servers to move Moodle data folder to a separate machine. Free up A and B to be web application servers.Â </p></td>

The Moodle database is 3Gb. 1.8Gb of this are the mdl_log and mdl_backup_log tables. The size of the log table is a known issue - every login and page access adds to this table. We can look at pruning it (deleting course 1 entries) or converting it to innodb - which means it wouldn't be locked while being written to. And replace the automated backups.</p></td>

# Nagios

Nagios is currently set up to monitor the following:

-   Moodle A/B/C
-   Moodle-db-a / Moodle-db-b
-   ldap-auth.ucl.ac.uk can be seen under the 'web infrastructure machine' (a load-balanced address that points to the three Windows 2000 domain controllers) - not sure if Nagios is somehow testing the ldap service itself or just pinging the server

# Recent incidents

-   11 May 09 - around 08.45 Moodle took around a minute to login. No problems according to Nagios. Must be external factor? ldap-auth.ucl.ac.uk maybe?
-   12 May 09 - around 8.50 - again took 45 seconds at least
