# Core Feature - Course Request

There is a feature of Moodle called Course Request where any Moodle user can request a Moodle course to be created by providing the basic details. \[sub\] Administrators can then approve this course request and it will automatically be entered into Moodle. This process would reduce the amount of time and effort spent on creating courses for LTSS.

The process is not perfect. MoodleDocs state this about the function:

# Course request

Location: *Administration &gt; Courses &gt; Course request*

Enabling course requests results in a "Course request" button appearing for all users on the All courses page. Course requests may then be viewed by an administrator on the Courses pending approval page.

**Note: If you enable course requests, you will need check the all courses page regularly for the "Courses pending approval" button. Email notification of course requests is not yet available.**

Checking for pending courses may not be advantageous and may result in either a in-house hack, further external development or reviewing implementation of this feature.
