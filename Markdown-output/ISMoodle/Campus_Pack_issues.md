# Campus Pack issues

# Needs fixing (blogs)

Links won't open in the same window.

Moodle Group members given CP View access to each others' CP blogs seem to have too many permissions i.e. can edit.

In order to configure their blog banner and permissions, students need to be given Manage Blog permissions. This gives students the ability to inadvertently render their blogs uneditable - if they check that box they lock themselves out and only a tutor can make them editable again.  Enabling 'Manage blog' also gives students a number of other settings which *seem* to have no effect, but which shouldn't be present for anybody except staff.

Staff can set deadlines but only day and month can be set, no time of day. So basically the deadline setting is unusable.

# Needs attention (blogs)

Insert image lacks standard configuration settings.

It is unclear how to find the web address of publicly available blogs, outside Moodle.

Sharing to (Moodle) groups fails without any alerts that it has failed - this can be solved by tutor synching, but without an alert they will not know they need to do this.

# Needs attention (wikis)

No ability to export wiki participation data - only exists on site.

# Needs attention (all CP)

At the time UCL obtained CP, the links to the Moodle Integration guides were broken and MV had to request them to be reinstated. Seems sleepy and neglected.

The support on the Campus Pack site is very basic, particularly with regards to the Moodle integration.

Core had an early 2016(?) session with the company and were not impressed – some aspects did not work on the day.
