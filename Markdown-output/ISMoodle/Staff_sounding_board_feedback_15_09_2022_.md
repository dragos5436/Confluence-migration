### SUS, usability score out of 100\*

staff 1    -    75
staff 2    -    82.5
staff 3    -    65
staff 4    -    72.5
staff 5    -    72.5
staff 6    -    75
staff 7    -    62.5
staff 8    -    35
staff 9    -    77.5
staff 10   -    67.5
staff 11   -    75
staff 12   -    47.5
staff 13   -    67.5
staff 14   -    65
staff 15   -    60
staff 16   -    80
staff 17   -    50
staff 18   -    57.5
Average (mean)- 65.97222222 **which is low so there is room for improvements**

**Note:** the median is 67.5 so not far to a 'satisfactory' - one user (row 9 in the spreadsheet rate most aspect very low with a score of 35 which brings the mean very low) another user (row 2) rated it quite well and the calculated score is 82.5. So it's not 'all bad'. I suggest someone should talk with the users which scored this quite low, especially to find out what's missing.

\*How to use the SUS scale score: the average System Usability Scale score is 68. If your score is under 68, then there are probably serious problems with your website usability which you should address. If your score is above 68, then you can relax a little bit.
How your scores should measure:
80.3 or higher is an A. People love your site and will recommend it to their friends
68 or thereabouts gets you a C. You are doing OK but could improve
51 or under gets you a big F. Make usability your priority now and fix this fast.

### Reading pane view

32% preferred the compact view (like Boost) rather than the expanded view (100% of screen)

45% preferred the expanded view (100% of screen) rather than the compact view (like Boost)

5% answered other (discussed in the session as them wanting both/a toggle on screen)

### Accessibility

-   None think it is very clean and easy to use
-   No. It is very clean and easy to follow.
-   Course Index panel is very busy with all items on show initially. May be worth them being collapsed initially. I like that it stays closed once you've closed it though!
-   Close block draw is currently an 'X' I think it would make more sense if it were a '&gt;' as when you click to expand it is a '&lt;' button.
-   Use of space, course index feature to look more tidy and have collapse all buttons. Don’t understand how images would behave, currently they are tiny especially on mobile view
-   The course title is not very prominent relative to section headings - I would be inclined to enlarge the Course Title font if that's possible.
-   Would be good to have the title fixed on the top of the page or on the fixed left panel, at present you have to scroll all the way to the top to see the Module name. When we scroll to a section on the main panel, could the name of that section be highlighted on the left hand panel? This way students can coordinate where exactly they are within the module at a glance.
-   Add expand and collapse all for the the courses overview page. Perhaps add upcoming courses, assessments on the landing page, so students are reminded of these as soon as they log on.
-   Be able to keep the right hand navigation boxes open Collapse All for the left hand course index Edit mode not very clear when on (red against dark blue background)
-   Tiles like icons are not clear to see. I like icons that don't have a coloured background. Like these <https://www.uh.edu/blackboard/blackboard-icons/>
-   It is a big improvement on the current Moodle!
-   I think there is still poor use of spacing in Moodle 4 - by this I mean that there is too much padding/white space that leads to 'the scroll of death'. To be more specific, look at e.g. a single URL Resource type. There is a large sized icon - it also now says URL on one line, there is then the title of the link on a second line. In the case of a File resource type it also adds details of filesize and type indented across the same line as resource type - visually it looks jarring in relation to the title. Where there is an additional description this is also on another line, which is understandable - if an item is currently hidden or has criteria affecting availability then that is another button on another line. Can't the majority of these just all be on one line? Can the icon be smaller? The over-generous use of space is something that is a regular complaint from staff. I like the styling for the 'Hidden from students' text - can this be applied to the resource type text in a different colour? One thing I might suggest at this early stage is whether the possibility of designing with easy to re-use classes that can be set easily by non HTML/CSS experts could be considered? e.g. modifying a table in e.g. a Label or a Page to use the 'table-striped' class to easily add a touch of style to a table. Another might be a class to easily add e.g. a coloured box.
-   -too much white space is a bit disorientating, especially when blocks hidden (keep blocks static is my preference)
    -Topic titles do not need to be bold. Headings under a Topic section seem larger in font size than that of the Topic title size. A bit confusing visually. Perhaps a closer look at Heading structure/font size/bold of Topic titles is required to improve visual accessibility.
    -hyperlinks are red colour - prefer purple and bold (better visually for colour-deficiency)

### Navigation

-   Navigation on the left to be collapsed by default for section you are not in, open for the section your are in.
-   index expand/collapse all
-   Collapse all on the Index. Collapse all/expand all being always available
-   More intuitive icons for what is under collapsed side panels
-   Not sure I would change any - need to work with it more.
-   Include a collapse all feature on the left side panel. Add a pin feature to the right hand panel Option to have the left and right hand panel open at the same time Add a toggle between the two views.
-   Easier ways to collapse all and expand all both for the main page and the left bar. Perhaps a different landing page depending on whether you log in as a student or tutor, or a toggle to choose the landing page. There shhould be a clear section about Wiseflow with links to student essay and exam submissions.
-   Be able to expand or collapse individual sections of the tabs on each Module Moodle page. Add expand and collapse all for the the courses overview page. I like the option of having the filter to see the courses either as a list, card or summary view.
-   Open on my courses landing page
-   I like to be able to know where in the course I am at.
-   Expand All/Collapse All for Index AND Content/Sections. Default view all collapsed.
    Default landing page - dashboard.
    Make easier to find courses - and see a compact list of all courses.
-   The Course Index panel seems overwhelming with everything expanded by default - would there be an option that is collapsed down to section titles only? I appreciate that it may then effectively duplicate what the Collapsed Topics are showing in the main, central area of the screen. In fact, it raises a question about that duplication and whether the central area should only ever show whatever section is selected from the Course Index panel. The 'return to top floating button normally seen at the bottom right in the current Moodle version seems to be missing from this test build? It is a useful feature and it would be a pity to lose it. If Collapsed Topics is to be retained as the primary course format, it would be good to investigate possible options on how to better differentiate or visually nest these. To be more specific, currently it is one long list of topic titles that all look the same - but staff regularly structure their module spaces in a manner where there is for example a clear Part and Part 2 to the module - or there are two separate Module Leads teaching. In these cases, they regularly ask for ways to clearly differentiate between the two.
-   -Land on the Dashboard is preferred where all my courses are available.
    -Can we keep the 'in progress', 'future' 'past' navigation on My courses tab, as this helps continuing students to access their previous year's Moodle course easily.
    -The Index panel and Topic sections should 'speak to each other'
    - ie. if you open or close a Topic section, this should open or close the corresponding index section. -Could Expand All/ Collapse All be available for Index sections as well?
    -The highlighting of the Index panel could be improved? Confusing at the moment as it does not feel 'in sync' with the Topic sections.

### Communication tools

-   A compilation of the latest discussions happening in the forums across all my courses.
-   Forum Announcements could be more easily seen by students, perhaps make the post visible across the top of the Course page?

### Other comments

Includes comments on -------:

-   fairly new user to moodle, looks better than before.
-   right hand block available to be open at all times if you wish
-   Not keen on the navy/pink combo
-   'This Course' is a really useful feature and would be good to retain, not in this these
-   Make grid format available
    Make a completion point for the index page to know what you have completed (similar to Rise).
-   Better use of space, more examples of course activities
-   Accordions within accordions to break down sections into sub-sections with their own sub-headings.
-   Less white space, if possible.
-   Can't think of any. A collapse all on left-hand block might be helpful. 
-   There is lots of white space. Perhaps a choice of themes so that if you have a sensitivity to white you can make it darker.
-   Keep it as minimalist as possible, so it is easy to navigate around the site and locate content with ease. With the current Moodle site, we have to scroll down each course page to locate sections, files or content, which can take a while if there are multiple sections and a large amount of content on the course page. I like that Moodle 4 has the expand/collapse options.
-   A dynamic dashboard. A compilation of all the latest announcements in all my courses. A dedicated course contacts block and prominently positioned at a pre-determined place as the standard in all courses.
-   Less white space to reduce amount of scrolling required, and show more information on the screen at once.
-   The 'Mark as done' button is a problem compared to the simple tick-box that used to be in place. It is better that it is off to the right though. Feedback from academic staff so far is they do not like it at all and would prefer a simple tick box again. In general, the theme works well.
-   - 2 column theme with Content left-adjusted and static blocks on right (i.e.. no need for Index panel which I think is unnecessary and confusing)
    - Activity/Resources icons look very large. Could they be reduced in size? I quite like that the description of the type of activity/resource is included.
