## Acitivity Plugins

 

## Blocks

### Slideshow: 

Early Years MA are very taken with using this for their fully online courses. Slideshow looks good and when used correctly certainly enhances the visual feel of a course space. At the moment it's only incompatibility is with the grid course format (image from slideshow presents over the displayed entry from the grid).

### Sidebar:

Early Years MA are very taken with using this for their fully online courses. Allows activities and resources to be placed in it, but a property of the sidebar is that they remain available even if the block is hidden. At the moment this sort of arrangement required activities/resources to be in a topic which cannot be hidden or they become unavailable to students. The actual activities and resources show up as orphaned topics at the end of the topic list however. So there may be issues with this as this is the same technique that the Sub-page resource uses.
