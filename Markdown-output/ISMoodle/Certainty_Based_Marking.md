# Certainty Based Marking

# plugin to allow export and import of questions into and from LAPT format

**Tony Gardener-Medwin says:**
It only needs expansion of a zip file (cbm.zip - at www.ucl.ac.uk/lapt/moodle/cbm.zip ) into the Moodle folder ..*/moodle/question/format/* to make a sub-folder called cbm, which will contain two required files (format.php, run.php, and an explanatory readme.txt file).
It's risk free, and doesn't require any other changes in code.

This was installed by RFG to moodle-pp (1.9) on 25 April 2008

**Tony Gardener-Medwin says:**
Please also add text to the Help files for Export and Import. I have written this in the appropriate format in the attached cbm.txt file in two parts. The first part should be inserted into
   ../moodle/lang/en\_utf8/help/quiz/export.html
and the second into
   ../moodle/lang/en\_utf8/help/quiz/import.html

This was installed by RFG to moodle-pp (1.9) on 13 June 2008

Both of these changes need to be made on any future upgrades/installations of Moodle.

 Pete - July 2009 - the help text was missing so I reinstated it for 195.
