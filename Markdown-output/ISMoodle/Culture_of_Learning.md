# Culture of Learning

As a team of the Education Change Portfolio, Education and Learning are at the core of what we do. We therefore want to invest in our team members to reach their potential through continuous learning.

The [SAFe Agile Framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) provides the [I&A sprint](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/inspect-and-adapt/) as an opportunity to do some exploratory learning as part of the [Continuous Learning Culture](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/continuous-learning-culture/). This is a great activity to have and really enables the whole team to find things that can keep making us better.

In addition to this, we also want to provide opportunities for the team to apply new skills as per the [70/20/10 model](https://702010institute.com/702010-model/) in [Features](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/features-and-capabilities/) that will benefit the Product:

 

The VLE team faces the usual challenges of too much support work, too much new end user Features we could be working on, etc, but while we do have to balance learning & transformation activities with other workload, we still carve the time for this, the Product Owners value the long term benefits and will endure the short term pain as an investment.

<p>200+ load testing plans run. A total linchpin for validating the work we did during that period.</p></td>

</p>
<p>Ansible - understand existing pipelines and keep amending them to suit evolving needs.</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li>We migrated all of our services away from RHEL6 by dockerizing them and placing them onto deployment pipelines (Ansible/Jenkins) - replicating the approach that was done through workshopping for the Wiki pipeline to all other VLE services - done by Ops team with minimal effort/support from DevOps team. Benefit - see Docker Impact above.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Redesign of Moodle Candidate build pipeline leading to massive improvement in pipeline runtime through parallelism optimisations done by Ops team.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>→ All of the automation benefits without constantly sucking DevOps teams' limited time, can improve on our own schedule (i.e. much faster than having to request central resources) and able to deal with issues that arise ourselves. Real team ownership.</p></td>
