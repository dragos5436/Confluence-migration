-   https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-filter\_embedquestion/issues/18 - this issue needs to be better investigated, upstream tests are passing - https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-filter\_embedquestion/actions/runs/1113054220 so this is caused by a clash with another plugin in our build

-   https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-qtype\_pmatch/issues/59
-   https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-report\_editdates/issues/42 - we have a heavy fork of this plugin, so upstream fix is murky wether relevant
