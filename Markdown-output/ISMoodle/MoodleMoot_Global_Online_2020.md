AS Notes

-   Look at Turnitin LTI 1.3 integration?
-   Moodle Quiz 4.0 - do we want to be involved? (https://youtu.be/vtcgYjbRYSU?t=12304 & http://bit.ly/moodlequiz4)
-   Teams - Teacher becomes Team owner. https://events.moodle.com/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=81\#p653 & <https://youtu.be/vtcgYjbRYSU?t=14110>
-   LTI in 3.9 - « When an institution adopts a tool provider, there is a vetting process around privacy, data usage and retention, etc... that is done before the tool is deployed. A new feature in 3.9 can limit who can add an LTI tool, making sure only vetted apps can be used by instructors. » - <https://events.moodle.com/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=221#p1812>
