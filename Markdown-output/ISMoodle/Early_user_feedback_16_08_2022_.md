# Survey conclusions  

([summary](https://forms.office.com/Pages/AnalysisPage.aspx?AnalyzerToken=T1mza9MBt0rW6GPZB3K41CRD1o10wlAW&id=_oivH5ipW0yTySEKEdmlwgyR_jHZA3BNgKv99Rqxtc1UM1VQUlZNOVQ0VDZaUEhFMTFBTENaTkxBNy4u) and [detailed responses](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?subpage=design&FormId=_oivH5ipW0yTySEKEdmlwgyR_jHZA3BNgKv99Rqxtc1UM1VQUlZNOVQ0VDZaUEhFMTFBTENaTkxBNy4u)) 

Overall survey responses: 2 (FLTL) 

-   “It all seems very straight forward and obvious. really like the + and the colour highlighting for the editing, much clearer than in 3.11”. 
-   "I know my way around Moodle generally but the admin bar at the top was nice and preferable to being placed as a block.” 

#### **Reading pane (Boost v UCL light): ** 

-   "Generally expanded but may depend. Crucially choice is needed.” 

#### **What, if any, aspects of navigation, would you change in this theme?** 

-   "The burgundy highlighting of sections that appears in edit mode would be nice in normal mode to show which section you are in” .
-   "Ability to collapse all index headings at once would be helpful - a lot of scrolling is otherwise required in large courses.” 

#### **Which improvements/changes would you like to see in the Theme, as we develop it?** 

-   “I liked the ‘This Course’ feature, which is not available in this version, would be nice if it could be brought back. Easy way to see what was in a course and jump to specific activity types. 
-   “Something to combat the very large image that some tutors place at in Topic 0. A set size perhaps?” 

#### **Other comments:** 

“Got a bit confused with the Show and Make Available for an activity. Made it available but hadn't realised that it wasn't set to Show so was still hidden from the Student view.” 

# Online session 

Discussion points 

#### **Index: ** 

-   New course index feature got a lot of praise. 
-   The green dots in the index represent activity completion.  
-   it would be good if you could collapse all headings. (many agreed) 
-   My Index does collapse, but starts in full list, would be good if default was collapsed. 
-   It would be nice if it remembered your last point in the course.  

<!-- -->

-   Would be nice to navigate on a touchscreen. 
-   If you use a label on your course and don't add any text (so an image perhaps) it just says 'label' in the index. 

#### **Reading pane: ** 

-   I think with the boost template here the main content should be resize to screen size of the device. 
-   huge borders are a little disorienting. 

 

#### **The Course Admin** **bar** is really clear and useful. 

####  **Dark mode:** 

-   I vote for dark mode to be added if possible. May also ensure compliance with WCAG's AA standard for contrast ratio. (many agreed) 
-   +10 for a dark mode, just on a personal level, that would be a joy. 

<!-- -->

-   <https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-68037>  

####  **General Look and Feel:** 

-   Blocks could be a touch wider. 
-   Discussed colours (pink can be hard to read) but limited with new Palette re accessibility – need to consult Ben and his team. 
-   I do like this view as its nice and clean:
