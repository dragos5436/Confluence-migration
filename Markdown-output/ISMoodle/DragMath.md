# DragMath

DragMath is a Java-based drag and drop equation editor.

see <http://docs.moodle.org/en/DragMath_equation_editor>

Installation is allegedly just a case of unzipping the supplied file and overwriting existing folders.

When I tried this before MoodleMoot and the holidays, it didn't actually work in Firefox! Repeatedly.

Now it does. This could be something to do with Firefox being updated or the latest Java update.

Fortunately DragMath is supposedly going to be part of Moodle 2.0 (along with the TinyMCE editor) so this problem should go away.

**Installation instructions**

1.  download and unzip <http://download.moodle.org/patches19/dragmath.zip>
2.  take just the /lib/editor  folder and use that to overwrite the existing /lib/editor folder in Moodle (ignore the adminlib.php - do NOT replace this)
3.  check it works
