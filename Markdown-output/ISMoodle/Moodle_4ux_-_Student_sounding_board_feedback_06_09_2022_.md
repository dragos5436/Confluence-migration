Overall survey responses: 4

### SUS, usability score out of 100\*

Student 1 - 92.5
Student 1 - 65
Student 1 - 87.5
Student 1 - 62.5
Average (mean) - **76.875 which is good but there may be room for improvements**

\*How to use the SUS scale score: the average System Usability Scale score is 68. If your score is under 68, then there are probably serious problems with your website usability which you should address. If your score is above 68, then you can relax a little bit.
How your scores should measure:
80.3 or higher is an A. People love your site and will recommend it to their friends
68 or thereabouts gets you a C. You are doing OK but could improve
51 or under gets you a big F. Make usability your priority now and fix this fast.

### Reading pane view

4 out 4 student preferred the 'compact view (like Boost) rather than the expanded view (100% of screen)

### Accessibility

-   "everything is fine by me, **maybe add some pictures from UCL campus** related to every page"
-   "Visually it looks good"
-   "Like that there is a list of participants - but would be great to have **chosen names options** too."
-   "The **accessibility theme also strips out some of the design features**, so for me personally actually makes it a bit harder to navigate, despite being a better colour scheme for me."
-   "I think depending on disabilities or personal choices, various adaptations are provided and available. I would maybe use a **grey-shaded theme**, or having a **black screen instead of white during night time**"

Suggested dark mode and greys in Theme design

### Navigation

-   "I would potentially **add a direct timetable** and not a page that transfers me to the timetable through portico"
-   "I personally **don't prefer the side pane** to navigate, also don't prefer that all options are expanded form the start **makes the information overwhelming**"
-   "Change bullet points in drop down menu to numbers/symbols. Would be great to be able to tick them off too and for those ticks to show in the drop downs."
-   "Maybe adding a button ‘collapse all’ and ‘open all’ on the compact view (with the menu bar on the side)"

Navigation improvements suggested and timetable on dashboard rather then Portico link.

### Communication tools

-   "I would potentially add a direct message button with IT services in case of technical issues"
-   "Was not sure how to access these"
-   "Having two kinds of forums: one to report tech issues/ask questions to professors, and another one for students to discuss material and content together (can be group activities)"

Better signposting of technical help seems needed?

### Other comments

Includes comments on dashboard content preferences and mobile version:

-   "I would like to see in my dashboard my calendar and have the ability to add uni-related meetings Maybe it would be useful to have direct access to a translation tool in modules that are written in foreign languages"
-   "Maybe add a section on the dashboard explaining the icons, as well as some student information, like upcoming events"
-   "Link to the class calendar/schedule without having to navigate away Link to the online reading lists without having to log into a separate page"
-   "The mobile version works quite well, but having a lot of videos and links to other pages/resources can be quite overwhelming too"

### Misc

3 of the students provided their email address if we (digi ed) have further questions.

# Online session

### Discussion points 

-   It's really way easier to find my grades for every module
-   UCL logo in top left is quite glaring, could you look to inverse the colours (too much white)
-   Is there any way to have my Chosen name in Moodle altered eg a Known as name. (Identify management)
