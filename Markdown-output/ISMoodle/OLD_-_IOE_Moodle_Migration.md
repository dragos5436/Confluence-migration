Comments from Registry

Faculty, Department and Programme data exists for the IOE in SITS at present. We had to bring this so downstream provisioning (cards, user accounts etc) could happen. It’s a bit scrappy and needs reviewing.

The plan is for module and diets to be done next. It’s critical that this happens in a reasonable timeframe for testing etc, to ensure that IOE students can do module selection in SITS in September. There are likely to be certain deadline dates attached to this work that can’t be exceeded – if we do, then we’ll basically have to pull the plug on enrolling the IOE students for this year. Obviously this means that our work and yours is completely interdependent, so we’ll have to liaise very closely.

## Risks

Responsiveness of ULCC

Registry completing course record creation

Impact on staff and students

Changes to environment may lead to possible confusion with existing students staff
