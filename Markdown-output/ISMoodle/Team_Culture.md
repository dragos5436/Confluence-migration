# Team Culture

We are an Agile Team, which means we strive to continuously Improve our Ways of Working, through [retrospectives](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/iteration-retrospective/). Retros are a place for proposals from team members and team leadership to bring forward ideas and proposals on how we could change to improve. **The team decides** wether or not to take these forward.

1) Active member of the Moodle community - contribute upstream to community plugins and core Moodle, collaborate with [Moodle User Association](https://moodleassociation.org/), Moodle Partners (Catalyst [EU](https://www.catalyst-eu.net/), [AU](https://catalyst-au.net/) and [NZ](https://www.catalyst.net.nz), [Titus](https://tituslearning.com/), etc) , [Moodle HQ](https://moodle.com/), [other Universities in London](https://sites.google.com/site/moodlelondon/), the UK, Europe and globally.

2) [Culture of Learning](Culture_of_Learning)

3) Aspire to follow the best working practices, including Lean, Agile, DevOps, [All Remote Working culture](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/),  etc

As per ISD policy, the team works **primarily remotely,** though the office is always available to anyone who wants to use it.

*"In ISD and ARC, we want to make the best use of our office space for community and collaboration, while **actively supporting remote working for work that fits that well. We are moving towards a model where teams are empowered to work in the way that fits their work the best.**"*

We all come in on campus for specific, **purposeful collaborative activities**, such as [TI Planning,](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/pi-planning/) Inductions Workshops and other team building activities. These happen ad-hoc, when they are needed, but when they happen we aim for them to take place on Wednesdays so we can see other members of the Education Change Portfolio.

We've embraced Remote first and[non-linear workdays](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/non-linear-workday/), to **enable better Work-Life balance** not Overworking.

While this flexibility is great, the Ops teams members remain aware that they must ensure system uptime and jump in at a moment’s notice during office hours, and ESS hours while on call, when something goes wrong (i.e. a dreaded CI) wherever they are and in spite of it being a non-linear part of their day. This is the linchpin that allows this policy to operate the rest of the time.

4) Provide a great set of tools for Developers, Learning Technologists and Ops team members to deliver their best

We have a good set of pipelines, automated testing tools and testing environments to provide quick feedback to developers about their code. This ensures we can keep developing the platform rapidly & iteratively to meet user requirements and without creating bugs or performance issues with the service that would slow us down.

Learning Technologists are the active drivers of what we do, they engage with the Moodle user community, bringing forward requirements and driving the adoption of new tools.

5) Culture of Automation - a portion of our time every TI is focussed on improving the automation of processes the team 

Infrastructure - <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/getting-the-ops-half-of-devops-right-automation-and-self-service-infrastructure/> - but also processes carried out around the service within the product (LT's Devs, Ops, TLs, etc) or other teams on our behalf (e.g. DES).

6) Recognition and Promotion

The Product Leadership takes an active role in ensuring team members are promoted by their line managers when they demonstrate the [behaviours](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/policies-advice/ways-working) of a more senior role.
