# ILP module & block

[Installing ILP](Installing_ILP)
The ILP (Individual Learning Plan ) module and block is being investigated as a way to facilitate communication between tutors and students around the [UCL Key Skills](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/keyskills/) initiative. This functionality may be supported by Moodle Questionnaires and potentially ePortfolio systems such as [Mahara](http://www.mahara.org/). Currently this initiative is delivered in the form of a [UCL Key Skills booklet (pdf)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/keyskills/resources/Keyskills-Handbook.pdf)and supporting [UCL Key Skills website](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/keyskills/).

]To summarise: you go to the student profile and assign them a tutor. Then, the tutor can see their student in the mentees block and clicking on the student takes them to their profile. I can't see an easy way to get from here to the PLP though, so I don't know how useful this block is. Students can't see the mentees block.</p></td>
