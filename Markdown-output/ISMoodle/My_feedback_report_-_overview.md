# My feedback report - overview

**My feedback** consolidates information that already exists in Moodle and displays it in a single-view report that is easily accessible and digestible, and therefore more meaningful for students and staff than what is currently available to them in disparate parts of Moodle.
**My feedback** is being developed in phases and phase 1 is being piloted from October 2015 by Engineering and the School of Management. Phase 1 comprises a report enabling students and staff to view students' grades and feedback across modules, to:

-   better understand student progress;
-   draw ties between different assessments and modules;
-   allow students to reflect on their feedback and make changes to improve their work, and
-   allow staff to identify students who are struggling with assessments and offer them support.

The plugin was developed in-house and phase 1 will go live on 13/10/15.

There are a number of parts to the My feedback report:

-   A free text block (formerly html block) called My feedback which contains a link to the feedback report and another link to the 'My feedback preview' course. Only users assigned the role of 'Pilot MyFeedback Report' can see this block.
-   A mentee block called 'My tutees' which displays all the students assigned to a tutee. Only users assigned the role of 'Personal tutor' can see this block.
-   A profile field called 'Programme of study
-   A profile field called 'Year level'
-   A role called 'Personal tutor'
-   A report called 'myfeedback'
-   A report called 'myfeedbacklink'
