# Role of a Feature Lead

For each Feature / Epic we will have a Feature Lead who will be driving this feature.

The Feature Lead will:

-   Ensure the stories for the next 2-3 sprints of the Feature are created in Jira, are broken down appropriately and meet the Definition of Ready
-   Have a grasp of the dependencies within the Feature and ensure stories which are key to delivering the feature within the TI are highlighted ahead of Sprint Planning
-   Ensure that operational documentation for the feature is up to scratch
-   Ensure there is an demo or update about the feature for the end of sprint
-   Liaise with the Moodle Tech Lead, Product Owner & Scrum Master as appropriate
-   Ensure stories for the Feature are completed within the sprint
-   Invite any stakeholders to the Sprint review that are relevant. (or Contact the PO if your feature is going to be demo'ed so he can contact the stakeholder goups, however the PO needs to know what is being demo'ed)
-   Feature Leads will look out for any blockers mentioned during the DSU in relation to stories for their Features, they will ensure these are dealt with and/or escalated as appropriate to Moodle Tech Lead / ADM.

Ironically I thought I was being original in thinking this role but actually quite common:

They're just not references within SAFe

This is a first draft / outline of the role and will evolve.
