# Skype plugin

**Athina writes:** In the past we had couple of enquires about videoconferencing or voice over facilities in Moodle (Michael Ashby is one I can remember). There is a Skype plugin for Moodle which I would like to test <http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=1108>
Rachel can we have this installed on the test server?

**Tina writes:** I read that it may have bandwidth hogging tendencies, something about it becoming a supernode!Â  (what ever that is) That would be worth researching before trailing.

**Rachel writes:** As we already have a lot to test on the <http://moodle-test.ucl.ac.uk> 1.9 server I'll hold off adding this for now. Once we have pushed out the existing plugins on this test server to the live server in a few weeks (scheduled for June 23 if all goes to plan) we can then think about new plugins to add to the test server.
