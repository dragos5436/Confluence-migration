# Pearson LTI 

`[Y] Data Protection - 19/7 - Response from Information Security Group:`

Many thanks for providing us with additional information. Based on the information provided, it seems like the tool does process PII. I have also looked at their privacy policy, and it says that they do collect/process personal data therefore the DPIA is required. They also mentioned the possibility of international transfers which our colleagues in the data protection team (cc'd) will be best to advice around data sharing agreements. Furthermore, if this is a new service which has not undergone the security assurance process, the supplier will be required to complete the attached supplier due diligence questionnaire.

Questionnaire sent to Pearson - some questions have been escalated. Questionnaire has been returned - KV and JN reviewed.
`[Y] Moodle Data Privacy Policy -  https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/admin/tool/policy/viewall.php?returnurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmoodle.ucl.ac.uk%2Fmy%2Findex.php#policy-3`
`[Y] DPIA - contacted ISG for support 16/7/24. `

a) is not classified as a high risk

b) Answers yes to several DPIA screening questions

Decision: Yes DPIA required

`[N] Site-level - for UCL School of Management`
`[Y] Actively Maintained`
`[Y] LTI version - 1.3`
`[N] Moodle Plugin`
`[Y] Product Ownership - will be owned by Karima Dyussekeneva, who is the module leader for Statistical Foundations of Business Analytics`
`[Y] Accessibility - VPAT reports were provided for MyLab Qualitative Business and MyLab Statistics. Available on request. Few areas for improvement. Other VPAT reports can be issued as required.`

`[N] Mobile Friendly - `TBC - however generally (anecdotally) they do not recommend using the Moodle app for launching integrated courses. 

`[Y] Known Issues - `

Clients are reporting that grades are not updating for some students in Moodle LMS. Reviewing logs indicates the LMS is 'Refusing score with an earlier timestamp' error message, which is linked to <https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-75947> ". This requires external action from Moodle and doesn't affect all students. Recommended remedial action is to use Automatically Gradesync (rather than Manual sync) from the beginning of the course.

`[Y] Testing instructions - ensure you are enrolled as a teacher on Moodle not site admin; create test student account`
`[N] Automated tests - Supported Browsers and System Requirements (pearson.com)`
`[N] Load`
`[Y] Icon - `Within the instructions for setting up the integration you will find a link to an icon that can be downloaded and used to identify Pearson integration to digital courseware.

`[Y] Documentation -`

We have a vast library of support documents for users available at [https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/s/educators](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.pearson.com%2Fgetsupport%2Fs%2Feducators&data=05%7C02%7Ck.vandersteen%40ucl.ac.uk%7C73e89fb301df4df18fee08dca5999d31%7C1faf88fea9984c5b93c9210a11d9a5c2%7C0%7C0%7C638567328250837940%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=xGIIUfZYkZE8EfZimVDrFpyjTQKTrnkzj5Z2V%2Bd36GQ%3D&reserved=0) From here you will find help documents for setting courses up and managing courses with integration as well as using the courseware itself. We also provide separate documentation available for upload to Moodle, and on site support we refer to as "first day of class" presentations with students to get them up and running if required.

`[Y] Sanity check in progress `

`There is an issue for the set up and course creation with Moodle 4.4. They have provided a temporary measure while they escalate testing on 4.4. Update: Moodle will be releasing a patch for 4.3+ on 12 August which will require a download/update of our current system - this was actioned on LTI preview and resolved the issue. Still need to test on Moodle Prod.`

-   In the LTI config screen ( the set-up) uncheck the box for deeplinking
-   Then try and add the main LTI link again - the Select Content box should be greyed out

-   Then launch

-   In the LTI config screen ( the set-up) check the box for deeplinking
-   This is obviously NOT an ideal scenario as you would need to go back in and change the tick box once the course is set-up to allow the deeplinking to be enabled. 
-   I think the upshot here is that it works but we need to "tweak" the process which is a little inconvenient. We have a change coming to the launch flow in Spring 25 which looks like it might bypass this so there may be a solution in place by Semester 2 25 but I have found our Jira story and it is  has a Major label which is good. Please continue to test the student journey if you want to, it should be unaffected by these issues, this is only for course creation.

In addition, there is currently an issue with auto enrolment for students as on testing, it was found that they are forced to register and to create an account with Pearson before they are able to access materials that have been added by their tutor on Moodle - 20/8/24 - this has now been resolved: numbers cannot be used in the student's first or last name but they are ok in the username or email address.

\[Y\] Moodle Data Privacy Policy - <https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/admin/tool/policy/viewall.php?returnurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmoodle.ucl.ac.uk%2Fmy%2Findex.php#policy-3>

\[N\] DPIA - JoVE is an existing library service since 2012 and the Moodle connectivity will not be sharing any information with the vendor that it has not previously had access to before.

a) is not classified as high risk

b) Answers "no" to all DPIA screening questions

Decision: No DPIA

\[N\] Site-level - tbc; initially just Biosciences/Life Sciences

\[Y\] Actively Maintained - tbc

\[Y\] LTI version - 1.3

\[N\] Moodle Plugin

\[Y\] Product Ownership - Biogical Sciences/Life Sciences in first instance

\[\] Accessibility - sent latest VPAT report from 2022; does not currently include testing report for LTI. Transcripts/captions are provided for most of the videos - however there are a number of accessibility issues with images/icons, for screen reader recognition of info and relationships, for focus order, link purpose, labels, colour contrast, reflow on zooming, headings and labels and visible focus indicators. While this may not impact the group of users who wish to use the LTI in Biomedical Sciences, we can’t be sure of this and are much stricter about recommending external LTIs which do not have high accessibility standards. Asked if there was an action plan to work on these issues in the near future and was advised that they will be undertaking a new VPAT which will address these issues by the end of August 2024.

\[Y\] Mobile Friendly - "It should work on mobile. If you have a phone, you can try adding the app to it (<https://download.moodle.org/mobile/>) and then test it out on your end. If you run into any issues while trying to set it up, let us know, and we can assist you".  

\[Y\] Known Issues - you need to enable third party cookies for JOVE to work correctly: there are instructions.

\[N\] Testing instructions -  n/a

\[Y\] Automated tests -  aXe automated plugin has been used for initial scanning of different pages present in the application; compatible with most browsers if third party cookies are enabled: Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox. 

\[N\] Load - Since LTI operates within the school's LMS, there should be no significant implications. 

\[Y\] Icon -  Yes, it's included in the setup guide

\[Y\] Documentation - tutorial here: [Tutorial: Using the JoVE LTI 1.3 tool in Moodle (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW6xa8ziHBM); also received set up guidance

\[Y\] Sanity check - staff - y; students - y

    [Y] Mobile Friendly - FeedbackFruits LTI tools are mobile-friendly and designed to function seamlessly across various devices. They are compatible with the Moodle Mobile app, allowing users to access and engage with the tools via mobile devices without compromising functionality. However, the user experience might differ slightly due to the limitations inherent in mobile interfaces compared to desktop versions.
