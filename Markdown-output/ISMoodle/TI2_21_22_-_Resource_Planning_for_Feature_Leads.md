# TI2 21/22 - Resource Planning for Feature Leads

CLC features: Segun & Conn's time is precious so will split off into a CLC-only version of DSU. Dev time will not be used on any other features.

AS&SG +/- full time on this too.

[TI2 - 2021/22 - Should do - Moodle 4.0 - Prepare codebase for 4.0 Upgrade](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=181240202)

Gets to use **upfront** as much of the Ops team as feasible in order to allow for 3.11 upgrade to be given a go ahead on March 11th ([Moodle 3.11.6 - Annual Upgrade](Moodle_3.11.6_-_Annual_Upgrade)) - this upgrade date can be stretched back to 4th April if need be.

[TI2 - 2021/22 - Should Do - Myportfolio infrastructure migration](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=172459339)

Requires approx 3 sprints worth of effort. So while DK can help with 4.0 upgrade he does need to be freed to do this in sprints 4/5/6 (could argue for sprints 5/6/7)

[TI2 - 2021/22 - Critical - Moodle Service Reliability](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=190613256)

We want to proceed with a proof of concept for [K6 Automated Load Testing](K6_Automated_Load_Testing). This requires at least 2 sprints worth of Ehsan's time (sprints 5/6/7?)

Adil&Dragos can continue on codebase for 4.0 (hopefully with 3.11 cleared by then) while DK&EA move onto the above features.
