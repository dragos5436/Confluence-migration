# ECs, SoRAs and DAPs

# Q&A

## SoRAs

1. What will happen if there is already a group override.
A: SORA will add a SORA extension group and make it highest priority.

2. Is SORA only for exam (e.g.moodle quiz)? it seems only has extra duration field, not something related to new deadline.

A: Based on my reading SORA could also be for coursework and assignment. See here under "What type of support does a SoRA provide?"  https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/support-and-wellbeing/disability-support/reasonable-adjustments-your-assessments

3. If the mapped source is a moodle assignment and the event is SORA, currently I just increase the due date by the extra duration (e.g. 30 mins). Should I ignore the SORA event if the mapped source is a moodle assignment?

A: No, see 2)

4. If the mapped source is a moodle quiz and the event is EC which should only has a new deadline field, should I just override the quiz's close time?

A:

5. Where do you find the SITS assessment info (something like: BIOC0007A5UF-001) that the SORA should be applied to? 

Remarks: it doesn’t seem to be in the AAA record. 

A: 

6. Where do you find the extension date if it is a “Coursework and assignment extension”? 

 A:

7. Does the number in “Extra Time | Rest Breaks” field mean “mins per hour”, e.g. in the case of 15|05, does the 15 means 15 mins extra time per hour? 

 A:

8. How do you calculate the extra time which should be added to a Moodle assignment / quiz? 

Example1, if I have a Moodle assignment open at 9am, due at 11:45am and I have a SORA “Extra Time | Rest Breaks” 15|05, how much time should be added to the due date? 

Example2, if I have a Moodle quiz which opens at 9am, closes at 11:45am, time limit 165 mins and I have a SORA “Extra Time | Rest Breaks” 15|05, how much time should be added to the time limit? 

A:

## ECs

1. What will happen if a student already has an override for an assessment.A: EC will override the original user override.

2. No time seems to be specified for the new deadline date in EC. If there is a Moodle assignment originally due at 01/Oct/2024 10am and I got an EC with new deadline date 05/Oct/2024, should the original time be retained so the new due date would be 05/Oct/2024 10am? 

A: 

# Assumptions

1.  We should NOT sync ECs & SoRAs for historical / pre-existing mappings. Just for the new ones made after this feature is made available.
2.  Can course admin override ECs/SoRAs in Moodle? No, these are managed in SITS.
