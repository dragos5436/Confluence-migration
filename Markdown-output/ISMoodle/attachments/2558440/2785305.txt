<h2>CBM import for Certainty-Based Marking</h2>
<p>This imports quiz questions from LAPT format (in a .js file) to Moodle format. Note that while
LAPT questions are often grouped within a section, with a common heading or introduction, Moodle
questions are always independent. It may therefore be necessary to edit the introduction into the
separate Moodle Qs. Certainty-Based Marking and LAPT format are described at
<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lapt" target="_blank">www.ucl.ac.uk/lapt</a>.</p>
