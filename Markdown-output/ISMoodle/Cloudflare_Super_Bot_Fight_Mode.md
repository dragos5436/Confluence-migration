# Cloudflare Super Bot Fight Mode

In order to improve Moodle security and utilise available Cloudflare tools more widely we have enabled some new settings for Cloudflare Super Bot Fight Mode.

Settings updated:

Enable bot fight mode on

-   Definitely automated: Managed ChallengeÂ 
-   Likely automated:Managed Challenge
-   AI Scrapers and Crawlers: On

To be able to analyse bot activity in Moodle in greater details and to have better control on how to respond to different automatic activity in Moodle from external sources we need a paid add-on called Bot Management for Enterprise. See info from Cloudflare below:

## Which bot solution do I need?

If you have a smaller domain and have identified a bot problem, we recommend Bot Fight Mode or Super Bot Fight Mode, which are included with your plan subscription. You can enable either from your dashboard, but these solutions offer limited configuration options.

If you have a large domain with a lot of traffic, we recommend Bot Management for Enterprise, especially for customers in ecommerce, banking, and security. To enable Bot Management for Enterprise and write rules to customize your bot protection, contact your account team
